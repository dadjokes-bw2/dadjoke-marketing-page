     <h3>Joe - Web Dev</h3>
     <p>I am a current student at Lambda School studying full stack web development. My passion for computer programming started years ago when a group of friends and I taught ourselves C++ in hopes of creating our own video game. Even though our ambitious attempt at creating a game did not turn out, the experience started a life long love for programming.
